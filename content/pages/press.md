  about_title: About the Project
  about_text:
    - WORLD's FIRST CANNED BTC is an original artwork by ZYBORN that seals
      Bitcoin — an immaterial, network-based currency — inside a physical tin
      can. The work draws on the visual language of industrial packaging while
      transforming the Bitcoin ecosystem into a sculptural object.
    - The limited edition of 21 pieces contains AI-distributed amounts of
      Bitcoin hidden inside each can, transforming the object into a kind of
      algorithmic lottery and a physical manifestation of potential value.
    - The artwork will be exhibited in London and offered in a timed online
      auction opening December 2025.
