    essay_title: The Can as Currency
    excerpt: "Zyborn's debut project FIRST CANNED BTC presents a physical embodiment
      of a fundamentally digital currency, transforming a mass-market household
      object into something both valuable and enigmatic. As global war
      narratives intensify, the can emerges as a symbol of durable, reliable,
      and psychologically reassuring food within an increasingly militarised,
      bloc-divided world. At once commodity and riddle, the can inspires a
      simple but charged question: what is inside? Bitcoin worth the equivalent
      of one million US dollars across a limited edition of 21 units. The amount
      contained within each can is variable, determined by AI rather than human
      decision-making, removing predictability and authorship from the act of
      valuation."
    excerpt_2: "For me, this project marks a welcome return to the physical realm,
      encapsulating capitalism itself as a variable canned good. The can is
      conventionally associated with sameness: every unit identical,
      interchangeable, mass-produced. Here, that logic is quietly subverted.
      Each can looks the same, yet contains a different amount of Bitcoin. This
      gesture foregrounds a unique affordance of digital currency:
      weightlessness. Whether a can holds 0.01 or 1 BTC, it weighs exactly the
      same. With a physical currency, this would be impossible, as coins and
      banknotes betray value through mass. Instead, Zyborn's work masterfully
      stages a tension between weight and worth, visibility and value, using the
      immateriality of Bitcoin as its conceptual engine."
