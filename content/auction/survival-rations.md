## About This Work

WORLD's FIRST CANNED BTC presents a physical embodiment of a fundamentally digital currency, transforming a mass-market household object into something both valuable and enigmatic.

## The Concept

Each can looks the same, yet contains a different amount of Bitcoin. This gesture foregrounds a unique affordance of digital currency: weightlessness. Whether a can holds 0.01 or 1 BTC, it weighs exactly the same.

## What's Inside

Opening the can implicates the owner in a performance: an irreversible action in which the contents are finally revealed — a wallet, user manual, and an unknown amount of Bitcoin. Like a transaction itself, the act cannot be undone.

## Charitable Impact

The entire proceeds of the auction will be donated to charitable causes focused on artificial intelligence and a foundation supporting visual arts exhibitions.
