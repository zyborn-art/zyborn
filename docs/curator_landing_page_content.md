## **The Can as Currency** 

Zyborn's debut project *FIRST CANNED BTC* presents a physical embodiment of a fundamentally digital currency, transforming a mass-market household object into something both valuable and enigmatic. As global war narratives intensify, the can emerges as a symbol of durable, reliable, and psychologically reassuring food within an increasingly militarised, bloc-divided world. At once commodity and riddle, the can inspires a simple but charged question: what is inside? Bitcoin worth the equivalent of one million US dollars across a limited edition of 21 units. The amount contained within each can is variable, determined by AI rather than human decision-making, removing predictability and authorship from the act of valuation. The generative activity of the AI does not shape the artwork through an external physical form, but through its internal, invisible qualitative content.

For me, this project marks a welcome return to the physical realm, encapsulating capitalism itself as a variable canned good. The can is conventionally associated with sameness: every unit identical, interchangeable, mass-produced. Here, that logic is quietly subverted. Each can looks the same, yet contains a different amount of Bitcoin. This gesture foregrounds a unique affordance of digital currency: weightlessness. Whether a can holds 0.01 or 1 BTC, it weighs exactly the same. With a physical currency, this would be impossible, as coins and banknotes betray value through mass. Instead, Zyborn's work masterfully stages a tension between weight and worth, visibility and value, using the immateriality of Bitcoin as its conceptual engine.

In this sense, *FIRST CANNED BTC* responds to a broader generational desire for tangible, real experiences amid digital saturation. At a time of screen fatigue and dematerialised trust systems, Zyborn proposes not a nostalgic return to the past, but a physical form appropriate to a digital currency, one that wasn't shaped by millennia of monetary history. The cans recall Andy Warhol's fascination with consumer packaging, mass production, and advertising. Yet while Warhol captured a new era of post-war consumer abundance in the 1960s, Zyborn addresses a contemporary urge to convert the digital back into the physical, while retaining the excitement of uncertainty and abstraction.

The metal can itself becomes a manifesto for new money: a sculptural object that could plausibly have existed in 2009. In an ironic reversal, the material of traditional money becomes the casing for a dematerialised currency. Meanwhile, the label adopts the language of canned food packaging: a simple orange palette, factual typography, consumption-ready aesthetics. Complexity is translated into the visual grammar of the everyday. The slogan further anchors the work in advertising history, positioning Bitcoin unambiguously as a product, while also acknowledging its energy consumption â€” a gesture that signals the project's future-facing concerns, and the artist's latent potential,where efficiency and sustainability increasingly enhance value.

Opening the can implicates the owner in a performance: an irreversible action in which the contents are finally revealed â€” a wallet, user manual, and an unknown amount of Bitcoin. Like a transaction itself, the act cannot be undone. Through materiality, concealment, and ritual, Zyborn's art skillfully probes how value is produced, communicated and distributed.
